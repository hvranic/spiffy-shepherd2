Dear Proseful Community,

I’m writing to share some difficult news. After five years of supporting your writing and blogging endeavours, **Proseful will be shutting down on November 30, 2024.** This decision was not made lightly, but due to various factors, it has become necessary to discontinue the service.

I understand that dealing with the closure of a service is never easy, and I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this will cause. Please know that the service will remain available until November 30, 2024. After this date, access to Proseful will no longer be possible, and all user data will be permanently deleted.

For our valued paid customers, refunds have already been processed for the most recent billing cycle, and no further charges will be made.

**If you’d like an export of your data, please send an email to support@proseful.com by Nov 30, 2024.**

For those seeking a new platform to continue your writing, I recommend exploring the following alternatives:

* Ghost
* Medium
* Substack
* WordPress

If you have any additional questions or concerns, don’t hesitate to email support@proseful.com.

With gratitude,

Jonathan Sutherland
Founder, Proseful
